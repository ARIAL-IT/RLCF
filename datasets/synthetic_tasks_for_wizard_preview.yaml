      question: "What is the principle of 'res judicata' and when does it apply?"
      context: "Res judicata is a legal principle that means a matter has been finally decided on its merits by a court of competent jurisdiction and may not be litigated again by the same parties."
    ai_response:
      message: "Res judicata, literally meaning 'a matter judged,' is a fundamental legal doctrine that prevents the same parties from re-litigating a case that has already been decided by a competent court. It applies when: (1) there is a final judgment on the merits, (2) the parties are the same or in privity, and (3) the cause of action is identical. This principle promotes judicial efficiency and prevents inconsistent judgments."

    input_data:
      document: "The European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued a landmark ruling in Case C-123/45, 'Data Privacy vs. National Security'. The court found that the mass, indiscriminate retention of personal data by national governments is incompatible with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The ruling establishes that any data retention must be targeted, proportionate, and subject to judicial oversight. Member states have 18 months to comply with the new standards or face significant penalties."

    input_data:
      facts: "A company discovered a data breach affecting 50,000 user records including names, emails, and encrypted passwords. They notified the supervisory authority 76 hours after becoming aware of the breach and informed affected users via email 5 days later."
    ai_response:
      message: "Based on GDPR Article 33 and 34, this case likely constitutes a violation. The notification to supervisory authority exceeded the 72-hour requirement by 4 hours, and user notification took 5 days without clear justification for delay. Potential penalties include administrative fines up to 4% of annual turnover. Mitigating factors include the encryption of passwords and prompt remedial action."

      premise: "The contract shall be valid for a term of five (5) years from the Effective Date, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions herein."
      hypothesis: "The agreement will automatically expire after exactly 5 years."
    ai_response:
      message: "The relationship is NEUTRAL. While the premise states a 5-year term, it includes the caveat 'unless terminated earlier,' which means the contract could end before 5 years. The hypothesis assumes automatic expiration after exactly 5 years, but this doesn't necessarily follow from the premise due to the termination provisions."

      facts: "A surgeon, while performing a complex cardiac operation, accidentally leaves a surgical sponge inside the patient. The patient suffers complications requiring additional surgery."
      question: "Can the patient sue for medical malpractice under the doctrine of 'res ipsa loquitur'?"
    ai_response:
      message: "YES - Res ipsa loquitur applies. This doctrine allows negligence to be inferred when: (1) the injury doesn't ordinarily occur without negligence, (2) the instrumentality was under defendant's control, and (3) the plaintiff didn't contribute to the injury. Surgical sponges don't remain in patients without negligence, the surgical field was entirely under the surgeon's control, and the unconscious patient couldn't contribute to the error. This is a classic res ipsa case, shifting the burden to the surgeon to explain how the incident occurred without negligence."

      facts: "A company publishes false statements about a competitor's product safety, knowing them to be untrue, causing significant financial harm to the competitor."
      question: "Does this constitute tortious interference with business relations?"
    ai_response:
      message: "YES - This likely constitutes tortious interference. Elements satisfied: (1) valid business relationship between competitor and its customers, (2) defendant's knowledge of the relationship, (3) intentional interference through false statements, (4) improper means (knowingly false statements), and (5) resulting damage. The publication of knowingly false safety information specifically targets the competitor's business relationships and uses improper means, distinguishing it from legitimate competition."
